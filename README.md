RFM analysis is a powerful and insightful method for segmenting customers based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary behavior. By analyzing these key metrics, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customer base, identify high-value segments, and tailor targeted marketing strategies to improve customer engagement, retention, and ultimately, drive revenue. The visualizations of RFM scores, segment distributions, and spending patterns provide actionable insights for making data-driven decisions.

-   What is Recency (R)?

    -   Definition: How recently a customer made a purchase.

    -   Purpose: Customers who bought something more recently are more likely to respond to promotions or return to buy again.

    -   Example: If Customer A bought something yesterday and Customer B bought something 3 months ago, Customer A has a better Recency score.


-   What's Frequency (F)?
    -    Definition: How often a customer makes purchases in a given period.

    -   Purpose: Frequent buyers are usually more loyal and more engaged with your brand.

    -    Example: If Customer A made 10 purchases this year and Customer B made 2, Customer A has a higher Frequency score.


-   What's Monetary (M)?
    -   Definition: How much money a customer has spent.

    -   Purpose: High-spending customers are more valuable to your business.

    -   Example: If Customer A has spent $1,000 in total and Customer B has spent $200, Customer A scores higher on Monetary.
